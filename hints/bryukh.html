        You can iterate text character by character, or you can iterate the letters and count them.

        If you are using a dictionary (or Counter), then remember that data type is unordered.

    <div class="answer">
        Be careful with letter cases, when text contains several letters with the same frequency. If you are using
        "Counter", then it can return various results for the max counter.

    <div class="answer">
        Let's suppose you got a list like this (maybe dict.items()):

        <pre class="brush: python">
[("a", 2), ("b", 4), ("c", 5), ....]</pre>
        Then you can get the answer with advanced sorting:
        <pre class="brush: python">
sorted(array, key=lambda x: -x[1], x[0])</pre>
        And the required letter will be the first.
