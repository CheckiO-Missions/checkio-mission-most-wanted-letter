        I have no idea how to start solving this mission.

    <div class="answer">
        The idea I offer you is to create some kind of map with letters and
        their frequency in string. In such map you can find the most frequent one
        and chose alphabetically smaller letter among few if necessary.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What instrument of Python should I start from to implement this idea
        into code?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Since casing doesn't matter ("A" == "a"), you should make the whole
        text one letter case. With <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower">str.lower()</a> you make letters lowercase.
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "HelLo!"
text = text.lower()
print(text) # "hello!"
        </pre>

        All letters become the same case. What kind of map should I use
        to store letters and their frequency?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For this purpose you may use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a>.
        <b>Read this article attentively, you will find there almost all info to solve this mission.</b>
        For our example "Hello!" this dictionary (unordered data type) may looks like:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "HelLo!"
text = text.lower()
mass = ...
print(mass) # {"h": 1, "l": 2, "o": 1, "e": 1, "!": 1}
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Ok. But how to create such dictionary?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should use dict comprehension from link above. Besides, you will need
        string <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_count.asp">str.count()</a> method:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "HelLo!"
text = text.lower()
mass = {l: text.count(l) for l in text}
print(mass) # {"h": 1, "l": 2, "o": 1, "e": 1, "!": 1}
        </pre> 
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        I see. But string in mission includes punctuation symbols I don't need.
        How not to consider them in my dictionary? 
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You should check each symbol with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.ascii.html#curses.ascii.isalpha">str.isalpha()</a> function.
        Besides, I offer you to use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets">set()</a> on text inside
        dict comprehension to iterate only over unique symbols:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "HelLo!"
text = text.lower()
mass = {l: text.count(l) for l in set(text) if l.isalpha()}
print(mass) # {"h": 1, "l": 2, "o": 1, "e": 1}
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I still don't understand how to proceed. I need a hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You next step is to find maximum number in dictionary values.
        It is your maximum frequency. Do it with max() function and dict.values() method:
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "HelLo!"
text = text.lower()
mass = {l: text.count(l) for l in set(text) if l.isalpha()}
print(mass) # {"h": 1, "l": 2, "o": 1, "e": 1}
freq = max(mass.values())
print(freq) # 2
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        I feel, I am close, but how to find the letter with this frequency?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For this step you need dict.items() method to get letter-frequency
        tuples from dictionary. Then iterating over that tuples get letter(s)
        for which frequency equal maximum frequency.
        And the comprehension to find all letters with maximum frequency is:
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
k for k, v in mass.items() if v == freq
        </pre>
        In case, you have more than one letter with maximum frequency, 
        you should wrap this comprehension inside min() function to get
        alphabetically smaller letter.
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
let = min(k for k, v in mass.items() if v == freq)
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So what should my final solution look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        To get final solution you should join all above code together, 
        declare the function itself and return your most wanted letter.
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def checkio(text: str) -> str:

    text = text.lower()
    mass = {l: text.count(l) for l in set(text) if l.isalpha()}
    freq = max(mass.values())
    let = min(k for k, v in mass.items() if v == freq)

    return let
        </pre>
        I hope, you don't think that it is the only way to solve this mission!
        There are a lot of interesting ideas you be able to see after
        your solution passes all tests successfully. For example:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
checkio=lambda t:max('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz',key=t.lower().count)
        </pre>
        Iterating over all lowercase letters, finding value of function for each, 
        taking letters with maximum value with max() which is also takes smaller
        (lefter) letter in case of few with equal frequency.
<br>
<br>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def checkio(text: str) -> str:

text = text.lower()
mass = {l: text.count(l) for l in set(text) if l.isalpha()}
let, _ = min(mass.items(), key = lambda i: (-i[1], i[0]))

return let
        </pre>
You solution may be changed in such a way. Tricky idea with iterating
over the letter-frequency tuples and finding value of function for each,
function with double sorting - reversed by frequency first and then - if
equal - normal by letter second. Taking minimum means alphabetically
smaller letter and its frequency. Since we don't need frequency anymore
we may replace in with "_" and return only letter.
